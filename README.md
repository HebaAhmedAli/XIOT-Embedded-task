*assuming using arduino uno:
connect the switch to pin 2 (interrupt pin)
connect the led to pin 13
connect the temprature sensor to analog pin 0
after making the connctions we can use arduino sketch to compile the written code and upload it on the arduino.


*i couldn't understand if you want the on/off states to be printed all the time or just once so i assumed they will be printed only one time on the change state of the switch.
when the switch is pressed-on- then "pressed" and "on" will be printed and when we change its state to be off the word "off" will be printed.
